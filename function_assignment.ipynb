        "   - The return statement in a Python function has two main purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "To exit the function: When the return statement is encountered, the function immediately stops executing, and the program flow returns to the point where the function was called.\n",
        "To send a value back to the caller: The return statement can optionally include a value or an expression. This value is then sent back to the part of the code that called the function, allowing the function to produce a result that can be used elsewhere.\n",
        "If a function does not have a return statement, or if it has a return statement without a value, it implicitly returns None.\n",
        "\n",

        "5 What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  - In Python, the terms iterable and iterator are related but distinct:\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterable is an object that can be \"iterated over\". This means it's a collection of items that you can go through one by one. Examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets. You can check if an object is iterable by passing it to the built-in iter() function; if it returns an iterator, it's an iterable.\n",
        "An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It's what actually performs the iteration. An iterator must implement two methods:\n",
        "__iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
        "__next__(): Returns the next item from the stream. If there are no more items, it should raise the StopIteration exception.\n",
        "Here's the key difference:\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterable is something you can loop over (like a list).\n",
        "An iterator is an object that keeps track of the current position in the iterable and knows how to get the next item.\n",
        "You can get an iterator from an iterable by calling the iter() function on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a simple analogy:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a book. The book itself is the iterable (you can read through it). When you start reading, you use a bookmark to keep track of your current page. The bookmark is like the iterator (it knows where you are and helps you move to the next page).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4] # This is an iterable\n",
        "\n",
        "my_iterator = iter(my_list) # This creates an iterator from the list\n",
        "\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 1 (gets the first item)\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 2 (gets the next item)\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 3\n",
        "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 4\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling next() again will raise StopIteration\n",
        "# print(next(my_iterator))\n",
        "When you use a for loop with an iterable, Python internally creates an iterator for you and uses the next() method to get items until StopIteration is raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "6  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "  - Generators in Python are a special type of iterable that allow for the creation of iterators in a memory-efficient and concise manner. They are functions that produce a sequence of values lazily, meaning they generate values one at a time as requested, rather than storing all values in memory at once. This makes them particularly useful for handling large datasets or potentially infinite sequences.\n",
        "How Generators are Defined:\n",
        "Generators are defined similarly to regular Python functions, but with a key distinction: they use the yield keyword instead of return.\n",
        "Python\n",
        "\n",
        "def my_generator_function():\n",
        "    yield 1\n",
        "    yield 2\n",
        "    yield 3\n",
        "Explanation of the yield keyword:\n",
        "When a generator function is called, it does not immediately execute the entire function. Instead, it returns a generator object. This object is an iterator that can be iterated over (e.g., using a for loop or the next() function).\n",
        "\n",
        "7 What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "   - Generators offer several advantages over regular functions when dealing with sequences of data, particularly in terms of memory usage and performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: This is the most significant advantage. Regular functions that return a list or other iterable construct the entire sequence in memory before returning it. Generators, on the other hand, produce values one at a time on demand. This is crucial when dealing with very large datasets or infinite sequences that would consume too much memory if stored entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular function: Builds the whole list in memory.\n",
        "Generator: Yields one item at a time, keeping only the state needed to generate the next item.\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators compute values lazily, meaning they only produce the next value when it's explicitly requested (e.g., by a next() call or a loop iteration). This can be beneficial in scenarios where you might not need the entire sequence, saving computation time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite sequences because they don't need to store all elements. A regular function would not be able to return an infinite list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Readability and Conciseness: For simple iterator patterns, a generator function using yield can be more concise and easier to read than creating a class with __iter__ and __next__ methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Pipelining: Generators can be easily chained together to create data processing pipelines. The output of one generator can be the input of another, allowing for efficient data transformation without creating intermediate lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to use generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "When you are working with a large amount of data that doesn't fit into memory.\n",
        "When you need to generate a potentially infinite sequence.\n",
        "When you want to process data in a streaming fashion.\n",
        "When you want a more concise way to create iterators.\n",

        "  - A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. It can have any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression. The expression is evaluated, and the result is returned implicitly.\n",

        "When are they typically used?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "print(sorted_pairs) # Output: [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]\n",
        "For simple callbacks or event handlers: In GUI programming or other event-driven scenarios, lambda functions can be used for simple actions.\n",
        "In list comprehensions or generator expressions: While not as common as using them with map, filter, or sorted, lambda functions can sometimes be used within these constructs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "Because they are limited to a single expression, lambda functions are not suitable for complex logic, multiple statements, or functions that require docstrings or annotations. In such cases, a regular function defined with def is more appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, lambda functions are a handy tool for creating small, throwaway functions for simple operations, especially when working with higher-order functions.\n",

        "Purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "The main purpose of map() is to perform the same operation on every item of an iterable without using an explicit loop. This can make your code more concise and sometimes more readable for simple transformations.\n",
